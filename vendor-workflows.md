### Guiding Principles for Preservation Master Files
* All preservation masters should be accurate and true representations of their source materials, and should be complete digital proxies to the extent that is feasible. They must maintain all essential original characteristics, such as (but not limited to) audio track orientation, aspect ratio, frame rate etc.
* All machines should be calibrated for the best possible capture of each item. This includes azimuth adjustment for audio tapes, and the use of a processing amp for video signals.
* Any manipulation, such as audio peak normalization or color correction should be applied in the creation of a reproduction master file (or mezzanine) and not applied to the preservation master file.

### Guiding Principles for Mezzanine/Access Files
All access files should strive to be the truest representation of the intended presentation of the materials as experienced on its original playback equipment. For example:
* Access copies of interlaced material should be deinterlaced as this is how a viewer would have experienced the original media.
* Mono audio files should be converted into dual-mono access files for correct listening experience - audio levels should be normalized if necessary.
* Anamorphic materials should be at their intended viewing aspect ratio.

### Preferred File Formats
[UW Media Preservation Formats](/digitization-standards.md)

### Preferred Naming Conventions
[UW Media Naming Conventions](/naming-standards.md)
### Expected Deliverables
* Preservation File
* Mezzanine File
* Access File
* Picture(s) of original item
* MD5 Checksums for all files

### Post-Migration Quality Control
* [Audio QC Script](https://github.com/pugetsoundandvision/uwmediascripts/blob/master/audioqc)
* [QC Tools](https://mediaarea.net/QCTools) for video in combination with spot checks
* Spot checks of random sample
* Optional in house capture comparison as needed
