# UW Libraries Media Reformatting Preferred File Naming Conventions

For reformatted materials, UW Libraries prefers file names that are human readable and self descriptive. These names should always provide a clear association between the digital item and its physical source object.

Preservation files created by reformatting projects should adhere to the following naming convention:

`[MARC Code for collecting institution]_[collection #-collection name]_[item number]_[side/part]`

For example:

`wauar_1693-001-jacobs_14580_side1`


## Instructions:
* There should be __no__ spaces or special charaters in file names. Only standard letters and numbers should be used, with the exception of dashes and underscores.
* Underscores must __only__ be used to separate components of the file name as shown above.
* [MARC Code for collecting institution] will always be  wauar for items housed in UW Special Collections.
* [collection #-collection name] Collection number and an abbreviated collection name must be included and separated by a ‘-’. The abbreviated name can be as simple as one word.
* An item number must be included in file name. This should take the form of the most accurate number that has been assigned to the item. (If a catalog number exists it should be used). Examples are:
  * `Box1-Tape1`
  * `99320152284601451`
* If desired a more descriptive title can be added to the item number by separating with a dash. [Camel Case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) is preferred for multi-word titles. Example:
  * `14-003-windowsOnTheWorld`
* [side/part] Sides should be included in filenames when applicable. This should be written as Side1, Side2 etc. If there are multiple regions on the same side that must be split into separate files (such as speed changes mid tape) these should be noted with the addition of lowercase letters. If sides are not relevant to the media, or if there is only a single informational side with multiple regions 'part' should be used. Examples: 
  * `Side1a, Side1b, Side2`
  * `Part1, Part2`
* If there is only a single side with a single region, side information does not need to be noted.
